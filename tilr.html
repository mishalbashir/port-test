            <span class="body">
            Through working on this project, I was able to learn and create an extensive modular design system in Sketch, taking advantage of Anima to create powerful Sketch symbols that take out the a lot of the menial copy and pasting and symbol instancing in high fidelity design, as well as being responsive to boot. An added benefit was that our developers were able to build full components from the blueprints of my sketch symbols.

        <span class="body">
        With over 100 jobs being created on the platform monthly, getting clients to post jobs themselves is a huge need. However, our systems and processes are too confusing, and very few, if any, users create a job by themselves.

            <br>
            <span class="body">Throughout our findings, it comes up that our current job creation process does not facilitate a learning process. We soon discovered the importance of guiding the user to the correct path and making the information digestible. With these as our main focuses, we began to tackle changing the job creation process to a more friendly system.

            <span class="body">When converting requirements and findings into solutions, we developed a step by step process in which a user will create a job. This primarily serves to break down our current process into digestible, related, and small sections to work through. tilrâ€™s new job creation process is designed to make it easier to understand and clearly see the overall job requirements.

              Being able to directly address huge usability flaws for our interal MEF team, as well as address the lack of self service for our users has been a highlight of my work at tilr so far. I'm grateful for their support, patience, and emphathy towards me, and I wouldn't be the designer I am today without their guidance.
