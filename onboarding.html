            <span class="body">
            Working on tilr's mobile onboarding, I was able to learn the huge benefits of the use constant prototyping (and iterations). Through the prototyping process, we were able to quickly iterate on many different onboarding paths, comparing + contrasting the benefits of each one. The ability of a prototype to be accessible to anyone made it especially easy to show to many stakeholders during the iteration process.

        <span class="body">
        Currently, only 15% of users that sign up are being converted into users that can be pushed jobs on the tilr platform. The rest have uncompleted profiles, which if not acted upon, will never be able to receive jobs. Additionally, a lot of the process is also conducted with a phone call, presenting an efficiency and scale issue as well.

      I had the opportunity to create a revised onboarding feature, guiding newly signed up users about the platform and towards creating profiles that will give them success. Additionally, it's aimed to reduce reliance on phone calls to obtain information.

                <br>
                Designed for modularity and scalablity, the onboarding process has a lot of interchangable moving parts. Precisely because of that, I had the opportunity to gather a lot of feedbck on how it should be structured through prototyping. By being able to iterate quickly and get constructive feedback with each iteration, I was able to better understand our path to the best solution.

              <ul class="body">

              <br>
              Whenever you have access to them, it's extremely important to rely on statistics and data in order to drive your design decisions. Because of our analysis of new users coming in, we were able to see a large problem area and address it accordingly. Prioritizing user needs and assessing if it's still being met constantly through data is extremely pertinent to success of your platform. Being able to leverage data-driven design was extremely helpful and re-established how much I still want to keep growing as a designer.
