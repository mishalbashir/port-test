      <div class="col-md-8 col-md-push-2">
        <p class="portfolio-body">How do you solve the problem of creating for a fast-paced mobile game while trying to communicate information to the player? What can you do to coherently tell the player what they need to know, in the least possible time? I was tasked with designing in a context where even a second too long can be the difference between life or game over to a player. Below are just a few examples of what I worked on for Sky Tactics during my work-term at Uken Games.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-8 col-md-push-2">
        <p class="portfolio-em">The need for speed (and understanding)</p>
        <p class="portfolio-body"> In many types of games, players are required to be able to make split second decisions under high-pressure environments. It's important to give players easily recognizable visual/audible cues that gives the necessary information for these decisions, in a reactionable time-frame. If these scenarios aren't designed for correctly, it can lead to a pretty frustrating time for the player. You don't want to be driving and suddenly your navigation tells you that you need to switch over two lanes in order to make a right turn in 50 metres <em>(looking at you, Apple Maps!)</em>.

        <p class="portfolio-caption">The <b>previous iteration</b> of the victory screen.</p>

      <img class="col-md-10 col-md-push-1 portfolio-img col-xs-12" src="uken/victory.gif">

        <p class="portfolio-caption">The <b>redesigned</b> victory screen.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-8 col-md-push-2">
        <p class="portfolio-body">The redesigned victory screen, while only being 2 seconds shorter than the previous one, was actually very important to the flow of the player. This animation would play at the end of every battle, and the long length of it would take players out of the "zone" (a mythical state of video game zen, where you and the game you're playing are one and the same). In this zone, your mind is 100% focused on the game. It's like being interrupted by yet another group chat notification when you're trying to get started on a task. It's jarring and annoying.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-8 col-md-push-2">
        <p class="portfolio-em">The approach</p>
        <p class="portfolio-body">Throughout my 4 month work-term on Sky Tactics, I completed and took ownership of over 30 tasks both big and small. These tasks would consist of major game system overhauls (Friends, Crafting, Messages, Store, Battle and Events), and many countless animated prototypes. Most of these tasks began with some paper and a pen. And lots and lots of sticky notes.
          <br>
          <br>
        These ovehauls and designs usually involved a series of steps:</p>

        <ul class="portfolio-ul">
          <li class="portfolio-list"><b>Classify the problem:</b> What are we trying to solve for?</li>
          <li class="portfolio-list"><b>Background Research:</b> How was this problem solved in other studios/teams?</li>
          <li class="portfolio-list"><b>Establish contraints:</b> What resources can we allocate for this overhaul?</li>
          <li class="portfolio-list"><b>Prototyping:</b> How will this look like in-game? Let's try it!</li>
          <li class="portfolio-list"><b>Iterate:</b> Does this solve our problem? Can we improve on it further?</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="portfolio-em">Costant Collaboration</p>
        <p class="portfolio-body">Throughout the design process and during much of my stay, a big part of my own personal growth took place in the form of how I learnt to collaborate with a team. Due to the team structures at Uken, we were always working in small, agile teams, and I learnt that it was very beneficial to get non-designers familiar with the design principles within the team. I strove to get all members of the team to partake in the design process, as well as take an interest in it. I believe that it's very important to get different persepctives involved in the design process, because at the end of the day, we don't design inside of a bubble. </p>

      <p class="portfolio-subtitle">An ingredient first recipe app</p>

      <div class="col-md-8 col-md-push-2">
        <p class="portfolio-body">One of the biggest issues that we face on a daily basis is food wastage. Every time we do groceries, inevitably we throw away a full head of lettuce, or a whole block of cheese, or even 2 pounds of chicken because we overestimated how much we would need, then proceeded to leave it in the fridge instead of the freezer (for a couple of weeks, <i>eek!</i>).
        <br>
        <br>
        Pantry is an ingredient focused recipe experience that makes it simpler than ever to quickly cook with the things around you. It takes seconds to find a recipe that you can make with the ingredients you have on hand.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-8 col-md-push-2">
        <p class="portfolio-em">Navigation</p>
        <p class="portfolio-body">Our first in-app navigation consisted of accessing different app sections through a top oriented navigation bar. However, we found out through some guerilla testing that when people are actively cooking, they seldom have more than one hand available at at time. It was difficult to flow through the app while cooking if many of the settings and navigation buttons were out of initial reach.</p>
      </div>

        <p class="portfolio-caption">Our first navigation iteration, with top heavy buttons. Yes, this app was formerly named Whisk.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-8 col-md-push-2">
        <p class="portfolio-body">The solution was to replace the existing navigation with a bottom navigation bar. An iOS standard for years, it places important app views near the bottom of the screen, easier to reach. Easier one handed use allows for an easier time using the app while cook, and was one of the ways Pantry differentiated itself from other products in the same sphere.

        <p class="portfolio-em">Reduced complexity</p>
        <p class="portfolio-body">The initial recipes view featured an overview page where a user would use a swipe action to access the recipe details view. We later found out from a friend that was using the app for us that it was simply too annoying a gesture to go through all the time. When browsing multiple recipes, looking for ones that didn't involve the use of an oven, it was simply an unnecessary additional step in the user flow. Instead, I realized that we needed to remove the behaviour, and have it directly link to the recipe details.</p>

        <p class="portfolio-body">Recipe instructions and ingredients in one area makes it pretty convienient to read at once, right? But what if I need to constantly scroll between finding what kinds of pepper and onion I need, and how to prepare them? To solve this problem, the seperated instructions and ingredients views comes in. You can switch between the two views at any time, which means you can have your steak and prepare it too. </p>
